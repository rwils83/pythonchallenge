"# python challenge "

# Challenge Zero: The solution for this challenge is found in problem-1.py
## Hint: Try to change the URL
## Steps to solution:
### 1. The answer is in the image. You have to find what 2^38 equals and change the URL to that instead of zero.
### 2. For my solution, I didn't want to keep having to copy and paste the URL, so for this and all further problems
###    I will print the URL at the end of the solution so I can just click the URL. The idea of this challenge is to 
###    do things through python, so I figured it would make more sense to do as much as possible through the            ###    applications.
