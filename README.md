#Python Challenge

# Challenge Zero: The solution for this challenge is found in problem-1.py
## Hint: Try to change the URL
## Steps to solution:
### 1. The answer is in the image. You have to find what 2^38 equals and change the URL to that instead of zero.
### 2. For my solution, I didn't want to keep having to copy and paste the URL, so for this and all further problems I will print the URL at the end of the solution so I can just click the URL. The idea of this challenge is to do things through python, so I figured it would make more sense to do as much as possible through the applications.

# Challenge 1: The solution for this challenge is found in problem-2.py
## Hint: Everybody thinks twice before solving this
## Steps to solution:
### 1. The first thing I noticed in the picture is that this was a Ceasar Cipher.
### 2. Python is kind enough to give us an easy function to solve these types of ciphers. 
### 3. I save the random text as a string to call .translate() on, which gives me the answer, or so I thought.
### 4. The text tells you what to do next once it is translated.
